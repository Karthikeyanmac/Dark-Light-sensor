# Dark/Light-sensor 

# 🔧 Components Used

•	LDR

•	LM358 -Comparator IC

•	10KΩ and 330Ω resistors

•	10k Potentiometer

•	Jumper wires

•	Breadboard

•	5–9V power supply

# ⚡ Working Principle

When photons hit the LDR, the electrons inside roam and creates a voltage,this voltage compared with reference voltage set by potentiometer and then LED glows(Dark detection).By reversing the logic in comparator we can get the light detection.
